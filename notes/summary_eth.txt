[2] eth_getWork - subsumed by getblockheadertemplate.  origin: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_calls_list.  Ross was implementing our rpc server against a miner that he had and it expected getblockheadertemplate.  if people use an eth miner it might assume eth_getWork.  however, no complaints right now, so probably ok to not have eth_getWork.  removing getblockheadertemplate could break people though.
